I'm Farid Karimli, a researcher and developer with a passion for the intersection of AI and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
My work focuses on designing intelligent systems that enhance accessibility, productivity, and personal workflows.
With a Data Science M.S. from and a B.A. in Computer Science from Boston University, I bring a strong foundation in ML
research and practical software development.

I've worked on projects like CameraMouseAI, that allows people with motor impairments to control their mouse pointer
using head movements, and KeyGlide, a keyboard controlled entirely through motion. I've also been developing AI systems
for specialized areas, like recognizing herbarium specimens, and exploring how AI can support education through
personalized tutors. I am involved in developing Edubotics.ai, a platform for creating AI tutors that adapt to different
course content, aiming to improve student engagement and personalized learning.

Outside of work, I like to cook, play video games, watch sports (basketball, football and soccer), and think
about new ideas for projects that can make a difference.
